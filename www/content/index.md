# ICD-10 / Anaesthesia

Healthcare Resource Groups ([HRGs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/secondary-uses-service-sus/payment-by-results-guidance/sus-pbr-reference-manual/hrg-grouping#healthcare-resource-groups)) are the 'currency' of Payment by Results (PbR) for admitted patient care, outpatient procedures and A&E attendances.  _Complications & Comorbidities_ (CC) lists, maintained by NHS England's National Casemix Office, are an integral part HRG design.

SCATA was asked by the National Casemix Office to review the ICD-10 diagnosis codes for conditions which, where a patient was undergoing care requiring anaesthesia input, the patient would be expected to consume additional resources from an anaesthesia perspective.

Secondary diagnoses on the _Complications and Comorbidities_ lists have a score of either 1 or 2 depending on how significant an impact on resource usage, with 2 being more significant.
